I wanted to build simple movie explorer on iOS for myself [https://moviecast.app](https://moviecast.app)

- no ads
- no notifications
- only useful info
- custom posters
- fast
- no account creating/friends
- no ratings (this is under question now)

I love letterboxd and pay their subsription, but sometimes I just want to explore cinema connections. What was that movie, where this two people played together? Who played with who, what other movies from this director. But what i dont like, is that all services just give you all possible info, shorts, commercials, some events. I just want to check list of movies.

So here will be little timeline of app. I still dont know what features to add first, so it's early.
